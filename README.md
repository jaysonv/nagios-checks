### List of Nagios Check Scripts
* **check_wls.pl** - Checks the health of a Weblogic instance using jmx and wlst.  This has been tested using Weblogic 12c.  Please send feedback when running on other versions of WebLogic.  I do not have access to older version to test on.  Full details of the script can be found here [check wls](https://github.com/throwsb/nagios/check_wls.md)
